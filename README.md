## Q&A ##

#### 1. Q: What are some basic tools someone needs to start doing a bit of woodworking? ####

        A: Tools such as screwdrivers, a hammer, a combination square, a hand saw, a palm sander and a chisel set are useful when you're just a beginner.

#### 2. Q: What is an easy method to repair damaged corners on a furniture piece? ####
  
        A: It is important to use a strong enough material to withstand possible bumps. Materials such as polyester resin can be used with a catalyst. When the mixture           begins to firm up, remove any excess by trimming it away with a utilty knife. The resin can be shaped with a file, rasp, or sandpaper wrapped around a wood bock         or dowel after it has become completely firm. The repair can be painted with water-based acrylic paints and lastly add a topcoat with polyurethane or shellac for         the finishing. 
   
#### 3. Q: What are different types of topcoasts and sealers I can use? ####
  
        A: Wax, Water-based clear coats, Oil-based clear coats, Shellac finish and Lacquer are some options.
   
#### 4. Q: What is the difference of refinishing and restoration? ####
       
        A: Refinishing completely strips off the old finish of an item, while restoration keeps the finish on the item. It is cleaned and touched up with color, if       needed, and a new compatible finish is applied.

#### 5. Q: What is the best method to maintain furniture ####
     
        A: Always try to dust with a clean soft cloth. If you need to use soap, use a mild soap with luke warm water and a clean soft cloth. You can also use lemon oil. We recommend Guardsman furniture polish and cleaners.
